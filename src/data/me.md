I enjoy what I do and I take my tasks to apply my knowledge to help develop innovative solutions with this internship role. As for my experience at Caldwell University, I have worked hard in my coursework to learn everything I can and grasp everything to the best of my abilities.

# Experience

I worked as a Data, Design, and Research Intern at the Institutional Research and Assessment Center in Caldwell University where I analyzed and evaluated the data from the university and performed extensive research, data reconciliation as well as created different schemes for better enrollment and betterment of the facilities of the university. Through innovative thinking and proper planning, I was able to bring forth new majors to be included in the university curriculum which has helped for better enrollment.
During the summer of 2021, I worked as a Full-Stack Developer Intern at a startup, VandraJMS where I mainly worked on debugging the code base and better implementation of the code pipelines to optimize the application.

# Aspirations

I am a team player and offer key strengths in innovation, leadership, and critical thinking. I can tackle a high-pressure environment and focus on my deadline if any. I am equally motivated to learn from my upcoming challenges. Since I have been working on computers for the entirety of my life and engineering being a key interest of mine since I was a kid, I would be a valuable addition to your group. I would like to enhance my use of mathematics and my love of computers and coding to build something that is furthermore conducive and indispensable to a lot more people. Last summer, I was also involved in a research project where I built an alternative aid for visually impaired individuals using an Arduino controller and machine learning. The project is tended to help visually impaired individuals to walk independently without any other help. It was received very well at the Caldwell University Research and Creative Arts Day and was acknowledged by many senior engineers.

I am interested in working with a technology-driven enviroment. The idea of working in a fast-paced environment using the latest technologies, developing high-performing algorithms to deal with everyday problems, growing myself while learning, and putting myself on top of cutting-edge technology, inspire me towards this industry.
